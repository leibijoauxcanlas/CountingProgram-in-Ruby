# CountingProgram-in-Ruby
As a project this Counting Program is designed to count to 100 in even/odd numbers(skipping one number/counting in 2s) from your chosen number.
We were learning about programming languages and differences between them and this was a simple way for us to try and somehow dip our toes into programming.
